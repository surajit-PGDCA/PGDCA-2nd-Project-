<h3>Student life at the Institute</h3>
<p>A Students’ Gymkhana Council co-ordinates student activities. Members are elected by direct elections. Faculty advisors assist the 
Student Body. Co-curricular activities are an integral part of a student’s life in IIITG. Our winter semesters are abuzz with sports and a 
cultural fest – Yuvaan. Students compete in both outdoor (Football, Cricket, Kabaddi, Volleyball), indoor (Chess, Carom, Badminton, 
Table Tennis, arm-wrestling, computer games) and cultural events (singing, dance, play). Monsoon semesters are relatively quiet with
students concentrating on their studies. Students can explore urban life surrounding the institute in Guwahati. Some of the pictures of 
our student activities can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Clubs@IIITG</h3>

 clubs: Programming Club, Robotics Club, Quiz Club and Cultural Club; however in future the number of clubs will be increased. 
Through these clubs the students experience a broad array of cultural, academic, technical and social activities. For instance, the 
Programming Club allows the students to explore their computer programming skills in the field of computer science and IT to
 develop a sense of professionalism. The Robotics Club gives a student to conceptualize his idea and design state-of-the-art prototypes in
 the field of robotics following the international standards.
Certainly, the student form concern clubs takes part in different competition on national and international level regularly.</p>

bolts come to life. The IIITG robotics club participates actively in inter-college competitions, and have won prizes at different levels.

come together and get their genius minds to collaborate.</p>

 are united within the walls of IIITG. Music, dance, drama, writing, art – all find expression in Yuvaan. It is a fun-filled event that

IIITG realises that fundamental imperatives like teamwork, leadership and sportsman-spirit are acquired only on the sports field. 
Therefore, despite a temporary campus, IIITG has done it’s level best for its sports-enthusiast students. There are provisions for 
badminton, volleyball and table tennis within the temporary campus itself. Apart from this, the college arranges for regular visits 
to an off-campus playground where students play cricket and football with equipment provided by the college.

<h3>Hostel Life</h3><br>

their safety. Ample green cover all around the residential area provides a visually appealing and healthy environment for the

<h3>Sports</h3>
<p>A healthy mind resides in a healthy body. Sports and games are a major aspect of complete development both physically and mentally for a person. In this competitive age, sports is equally essential to supplement and enhance the academic development. The students at IIITG indulge in a number of sporting activities like basketball, football, badminton, etc. which inculcate in them a spirit to participate, compete and win. IIIT Guwahati has its annual techno-cultural-sports fest named “Yuvaan” to give equal opportunities to boys and girls to portray their skills in various fields of recreation and sports. Also, we encourage students to take part in various inter IIIT/institutes sports events, so as to cater the need of performance outside the campus premises on which our students perform at par with other institutes. IIIT Guwahati secured overall second runner’s up trophy in the recent inter IIIT sports meet held at IIITDM Kancheepuram, 2016. Also, in the same meet, one of our students emerged as a dark horse in carom bagging a Gold medal for IIITG and was adjudged the best player in the category.</p>
